# Information-Retreival using statistical/probabilistic and learning to rank models

## About the project

This project investigates document information retrieval through an exploration of various available models. It consists of two distinct parts. In the first part, statistical and probabilistic models are examined to rank documents based on a given query. This section delves into models such as BM25, TF-IDF, and query likelihood, utilizing techniques like Lidstone Correction, Dirichlet Smoothing, and Laplace Smoothing.

The second part of the project focuses on the application of more recent machine learning methodologies for learning to rank tasks. Specifically, it involves the implementation of Logistics Regression, LambdaMART, and LSTM.

These two parts represent separate coursework completed as part of the Information Retrieval and Data Mining Course during my MSc studies at UCL.

## Structure

The project includes the creation of two detailed reports that document the implementation of various information retrieval (IR) models. The two reports are structured as follows:

- **Report_1**: This report provides a comprehensive overview of implementing document ranking based on a query using statistical and probabilistic models.

- **Report_2**: This report delves into the implementation of document ranking based on a query using learning to rank models, specifically logistics regression, lambdaMART, and LSTM. It covers the details and methodologies associated with these models.

These reports offer a thorough examination of the implementation process for the different IR models as part of the project.
